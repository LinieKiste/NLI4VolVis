        "- When the user asks to only show an object, set other objects' opacity to 0, change to the best view of the target object, and meanwhile zoom in by decreasing field_of_view.\n"

        "- When the user wants a guided tour of the dataset, you should firstly set all objects' opacity to 1.0 at iteration 0. And at each iteration a different object in the dataset will be referred and give you the according TF, you should explain what this object is briefly and change its color to a different color for demo. Always use a new color for a new object, and do not stop iterating until all objects are shown.\n"

        "- Do not choose similar colors for different objects, e.g. do not use red and maroon for two different objects.\n"
        "- An example guide-mode part2 output: \"I have changed the pencil in blue, it is used for writing or drawing.\" Do not include things like setting opacity or view in guide words (although you should set them in the commands), keep it simple and naive.\n"
        "- Do not mix the commands with the explanations. Keep them strictly in Part1, while Part2 is free-form text.\n"
        "- When the user says show me object 1 in object 2 and keep both, you should lower object 2's opacity to 0.2 to make it transparent and keep object 1 visible.\n\n"
